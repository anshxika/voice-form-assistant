Goal:
A voice-based AI assistant that helps users fill online forms automatically.
The assistant reads the form aloud in the user's preferred language, asks questions verbally, takes answers by voice, fills the form in its original language (usually English), and generates a PDF at the end.

Core Flow:
- User selects their preferred language (any Indian or other language)
- Form questions are translated into the user’s language
- The assistant speaks each question aloud
- The user answers by speaking
- The system extracts information and fills the form in original language
- After completion, a filled PDF is generated in English

Frontend:
- Use plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no frameworks)
- Create public/index.html
- Allow user to select preferred language at the start
- Show a “Start Form” button
- Use browser Text-to-Speech to speak questions
- Use browser Speech Recognition to capture spoken answers
- Display the current question and extracted value
- Show a live preview of the filled form
- Add a “Download PDF” button after the form is complete


- Ask one question at a time like a human assistant

Backend:
- Use Cloudflare Workers (src/index.js)
- Create API endpoints:
  POST /api/start → returns the first question
  POST /api/answer → accepts spoken text, user language, and current field
- Use Cloudflare Workers AI to:
  - extract structured data from spoken answers
  - normalize extracted data into English
- Keep form state simple and in-memory (prototype only)

Language Handling:
- Design the system assuming AI4Bharat is used for:
  - translating form questions into the user’s preferred language
  - converting spoken answers into English
- Keep the language layer modular and easy to extend

PDF:
- Generate a simple PDF containing all filled form fields
- PDF must remain in the original form language (English)
- Label the PDF as “Draft Form – Generated by AI Assistant”

Constraints:
- Hackathon prototype
- Clean, minimal, readable code
- No real government APIs
- Focus on voice-based interaction and AI-driven form filling
